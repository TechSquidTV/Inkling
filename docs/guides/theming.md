# Frontend Theming Guide

This project uses a layered approach to theming with Tailwind CSS v4 to separate the base design system from application-specific overrides.

## Architecture

The theming logic is split into two main CSS files located in `web/src/`:

1.  **`shadcn-theme.css`**: Contains the base theme variables.
    *   This file represents the "standard" shadcn/ui design tokens (colors, radius, etc.).
    *   It serves as the foundation and should generally contain the default values from a chosen theme (e.g., "Zinc", "Slate").
    *   **Do not edit this file directly** for small tweaks; treat it as an upstream dependency or a baseline.

2.  **`index.css`**: The main entry point for global styles.
    *   Imports `shadcn-theme.css`.
    *   Contains **overrides** for the base theme.
    *   Place any custom global styles or modifications to the base variables here.

### How it Works

The `index.css` file imports the base theme:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
@import 'tw-animate-css';
@import './shadcn-theme.css'; /* Base variables */

/* ... */

@layer base {
  /* Application-specific overrides */
  :root {
    --background: oklch(0.99 0 0); /* Overrides base background */
  }
}
```

By defining variables in `index.css` after the import (or in a layer with higher specificity), you can effectively "skin" the application without polluting the standardized base theme.

## Customizing the Theme

To change the look and feel of the application:

1.  **Full Theme Replacement**: Replace the contents of `shadcn-theme.css` with a new set of CSS variables from a theme generator.
2.  **Specific Tweaks**: Add overrides in `index.css` for specific variables you want to change (e.g., just the `--primary` color).

## Resources

Use these tools to generate compatible theme variables:

*   **[shadcn/ui Themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes)**: The official theme generator. Copy the CSS variables and paste them into `shadcn-theme.css`.
*   **[tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com/)**: A visual tool for fine-tuning shadcn themes. Great for generating precise color values.
